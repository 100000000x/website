In this post, we will write user interface in React for token-based authentication to Django backend. We will use code from previous post: [Token Based Authenitcation with Django Rest Framework and Djoser](/blog/token-based-authentication-django-rest-framework-djoser) (code with tag [v2](https://github.com/saasitive/django-react-boilerplate/tree/v2))

What we will do
