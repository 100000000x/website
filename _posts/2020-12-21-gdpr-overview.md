Equip your SaaS with legal bases so that the use of your website is safe for users and you. If you search for different sites, the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service differ from each other. The same with the cookies. Each piece of information has varying meanings for the website, and it concludes crucial statements. There's no unique example for all websites because of the specification, the idea of webites, purpose, kind and other features, collected data.

Usually, websites are available around the world, including Europe. Thus, you have to take care of your European users' personal data. It is required by the law of the European Union, to be exact the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR). But it could seem challenging to differentiate such users by giving some of the privileges.

Here's the GDPR's source https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj 

All these documents, amenities are nothing but SaaS and User Agreement where SaaS declares:

*to support some service described in Terms of Service and treat Users personal data with respect to GDPR what is mentioned in Privacy Policy,*

and User state that:

*he's going to use your website, service according to Terms of service, and give necessary personal data, but you must use them as intended and provide adequate protection.*

## Where to start with GDPR

There's no direct dictation to implement the Personal Data Protection Policy (mentioned in art. 24 GDPR). Still, it would be transparent to collect all rules and ways of handling data in one document. It will include a defined, very narrow catalog of mandatory documents: a register of processing activities, a record of categories of processing activities, documentation of personal data breaches, documentation related to the conduct of a data protection impact assessment, and prior consultations with the supervisory authority. 
After this document is ready, you can start creating your idea and figuring out how your project will affect personal data. The important stuff is to figure out the best security measures to keep your users safe. 

If you already prepared the Personal Data Protection Policy, you know that the next step (after creation) is to **assess the risk** for your users' data by filling **Data Protection Impact Assessment and Privacy by Design**. Not every project needs to be checked by Data Protection Impact Assessment, each EU member state defines the catalog itself, but we recommend to do it for each project. Then you can start building your website.

**Check the providers** with whom you intend to conclude contracts, their privacy policy, the method of data protection, where the data is stored, whether in the EU or outside. Start to build **Privacy Policy and Terms of Service**. Check if all your documents and your SaaS contain key provisions and ensure that the principles of respecting users' personal data are respected.
