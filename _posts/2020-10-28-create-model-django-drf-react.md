In this post, we will create a new model in Django. We will create a REST API to this model with Django Rest Framework (DRF). We will create user interface in React that will be able to list all objects and add a new object to the database.

We will use code from previous post: [React Token Based Authentication to Django Backend](/blog/react-token-based-authentication-django) (code with tag [v3](https://github.com/saasitive/django-react-boilerplate/tree/v3))
