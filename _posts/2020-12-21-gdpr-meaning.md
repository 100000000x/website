(The General Data Protection Regulation)

Earn users' trust by respecting and securing their data since 2018 r. The European Union (EU) has imposed a new obligation on entrepreneurs to protect customers' personal data. A duty for one another is a right, a tool to defend one's rights. Each user should have the right to decide on providing information about himself, resign from using his data, delete his account. It's a strong right that should be obeyed by everyone. Why? Because of substantial penalties, up to 20 mln euro! Be well prepared with Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and GDPR requirements. 

## GDPR meaning

The General Data Protection Regulation is an EU law regulation on data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also regulates how to proceed when personal data are transferred outside the EU and EEA areas.

**Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable person**, also known as the data subject. Example of personal data:

- first name and last name, 
- address,
- ID /Passport number, 
- Income, 
- cultural features, 
- IP address.

That law gives a strong right for people to manage their data. It protects us, physical people, before the abuse. It imposes an obligation on companies to ensure everyone the right to: get information about his data, obtain access to personal data, correct his data, erased data - to be forgotten, object to the processing of personal data for marketing purposes, request the restriction of the processing of personal data, data portability - receive personal data in a machine-readable format and send it to another controller, request that decisions based on automated processing concerning or significantly affecting the user and based on his data are made by natural persons, not only by computers and the right to be notified - if data has been a breach (a person should be informed within 72 hours of first having become aware of the violation). How to ensure that these rights are respected for SaaS users?
