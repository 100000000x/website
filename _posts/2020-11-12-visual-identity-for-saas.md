Are you going to start your business as a SaaS? Have you got an idea and now you want to settle up your website, but you're not a graphic designer? Start here by creating your Visual Identity Book.

Why it is so useful? It will help you to smooth your website, make your SaaS recognizable, will be handy for preparing presentations, advertising on the Internet, or social media e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. Would it be comfortable to keep all branding graphics in one place? For sure, but is it not a waste of time?

Too many questions above. Now let’s make some answers. Visual identification is the basic tool for creating the company image on the market. You may view thousands of websites and some stayed in your mind. That means the graphic designers done a good job. There are some rules by which you can create a consistent look for a brand. Basic visual identity consists of features like: logo, colors, font, icons, and pictures and all these elements give a consistent look to the website. Collect them in one place called Visual Identity Book. This book will save you a lot of time, and your co-workers will know how to properly engage in building a website and strengthen your brand recognition. All this will ensure that the prepared content (and tutorials, advertisements, graphics, charts) will inspire trust, positive perception of users, and the message will be uniform.

You can achieve effective visual identification on your website with these steps:

1.	 Some creative work to do. Try to imagine your service with a miniature or with one tool, thing, object. Scrawl a few pages to find that one you will identify (including an abstract spot) or... look for some inspirations on the Internet. The best way is to prepare your logo in vector so you can use it in many materials, advertisement, website. You just can scale it, vector graphics need less space for storage. It will make website loading faster. Search similar projects, compare or try logo generators e.g. (but for most of them you have to pay). An easy way is to use a free, unusual font and give the name of your business. An example is saasitive.com, where we used two different fonts:
